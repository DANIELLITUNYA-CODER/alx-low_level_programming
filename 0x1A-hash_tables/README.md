# Hash Tables Project

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program's curriculum. It involves the implementation of various functions related to hash tables in the C programming language.

## Description

Hash tables are an essential data structure used for efficient data storage and retrieval. This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in working with hash tables, including understanding hash functions, collision handling, and practical applications.

## Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of hash table implementation. Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

1. **hash_table_create**: Function to create a new hash table with a given size.
2. **hash_djb2**: Implementation of the djb2 hash function.
3. **key_index**: Function to find the index of a key in the hash table array.
4. **hash_table_set**: Function to add or update an element in the hash table.
5. **hash_table_get**: Function to retrieve the value associated with a key.
6. **hash_table_print**: Function to print the contents of the hash table.
7. **hash_table_delete**: Function to delete a hash table and free allocated memory.

## Usage

To compile the code, use the following commands:

```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 *.c -o hash_tables
